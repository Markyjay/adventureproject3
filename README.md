## Objective

Design an interactive choose your own adventure game.
The project is deployed on Heroku, using Python.
---

## Brief

### **H**unters **A**rena

The goal of this site is to provide an interactive adventure game with various paths and scenarios.
The final product should:

- be programmatically error free.
- be written using Python.
- have paths leading to an ending that returns to beginning to allow replayability.
- handle all user input errors appropriately.
- give clear instructions regarding use and valid inputs.

---



## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
